<h2 id="personal-readme">Personal README</h2>
<p>Inspired by Adrien Joly&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/adrienjoly/adrienjoly.github.com">README</a>, this text aims at introducing myself and sharing some information that may be helpful for us to break the ice, communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively.</p>
<p>In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow looks like.</p>
<h3 id="random-facts">Random facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m driven by efficiency and improvement in general. This makes me exigent with others, but also with myself.</li>
<li>I love reading more than anything. I was that guy at school who would wander in the library during recess, looking for a book to finish before the next day.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard for me to get bored. There is no such thing as &ldquo;free time&rdquo; in my world. it&rsquo;s just time to do something else. I like keeping busy, it helps me focus.</li>
<li>I will always spend more time listening than speaking. I can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t want to say anything unless I have all the intel at hand.</li>
<li>I enjoy much very wit.</li>
<li>I have no musical education apart from what school taught me, but at 28 I am learning to play the guitar. We will see where it brings me.</li>
<li>I trust people easily but if you lose that trust, you will have a lot of work to get it back</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-my-favorite-things-to-work-on">What are my favorite things to work on</h3>
<ul>
<li>Impossible ideas. I take a lot of pleasure in thinking how to turn an idea into doable sub-tasks.</li>
<li>Learning. Above all, it gives sense to everything I do.</li>
<li>Tinkering. Building physical stuff.</li>
<li>Reusing code. The dev environment is a giant lego playground. You can get further by using pieces that already exist rather than building your own.</li>
<li>Refactoring. Make code more reliable, sustainable and easier to read / troubleshoot / reason about.</li>
<li>Reading code. I love to see/learn new ways to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Discussing solutions. I have found marvelous things at the intersection of minds.</li>
<li>Finding tasks for personal improvements. Applies to me or people I manage, I want to help people be better at what they do.</li>
<li>Writing automated tests. It frees my mind knowing that a piece of code is covered, and that I would be warned if it stops doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-value-from-others">What I value from others</h3>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency &amp; conciseness. No need to wrap your question in fluff and sugar, go straight to the point, I am a fast context switcher. If I am missing something, I will tell you.</li>
<li>Transparency. I can&rsquo;t go anywhere if I can&rsquo;t see.</li>
<li>Exigence. I want to be the best at what I do so you better do the same.</li>
<li>Traceability. So much time is lost trying to remember. Lay it down on paper once and for all and now you can safely forget it.</li>
<li>Benevolence. Understand what your acts actually mean for others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-think-are-my-strengths">What I think are my strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accountability. If shit hits the fan under my watch, I will not look the other way. I will make sure to be someone you can rely on.</li>
<li>Laziness. You can trust me in finding the shortest path.</li>
<li>Pedagogy. I love to help people understand stuff, and the process of documenting and vulgarizing.</li>
<li>Leadership. You can&rsquo;t build anything sustainable without people. As it happens I love helping people thrive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-im-working-to-improve">Things I&rsquo;m working to improve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conflict management. I feel uncomfortable when conflicts happen. I prefer to say nothing until the tension is gone. I am practicing finding the right words during the conflict rather than after.</li>
<li>Operational constraints. Being more focused on quality, I tend to disregard or lower the importance of operational constraints. I am learning how to compromise.</li>
<li>Speed. My focus on quality inevitably leads to longer delays. I try to take &ldquo;quick wins&rdquo; more into account.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-makes-me-uncomfortable">What makes me uncomfortable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finding out things at the very last moment when you know it could have been known beforehand.</li>
<li>People that react badly to wit. They end up thinking I am making fun of them which makes me very uneasy.</li>
<li>When people recognize me but I don&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but when it does It makes me feel like I do not give them the respect they deserve.</li>
<li>Having a conflict in front of people. 99% of conflicts I have to handle are 1 vs. 1. It makes no sense to have this conflict with an audience, apart from discrediting both sides.</li>
<li>When people talk too much. I won&rsquo;t stop them by politeness, but it makes me feel I am wasting my time and I am afraid my attitude might show disrespect.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-makes-me-happy">What makes me happy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Witnessing a small gesture of kindness in the street. (i.e. Somebody giving back a stranger&rsquo;s metro ticket that fell out of her pocketâ¦)</li>
<li>Helping people.</li>
<li>When things just work.</li>
<li>Movement.</li>
<li>Capoeira.</li>
<li>Light.</li>
<li>Fire.</li>
<li>When a new feature does not need a patch once sent to production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-expect-from-my-managers">What I expect from my managers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Defend the interests of the team.</li>
<li>Understand people individually.</li>
<li>Exigence.</li>
<li>Managing is to serve, not to be served.</li>
<li>Criticize in private, congratulate in public.</li>
<li>Give visibility to the team.</li>
<li>Exemplarity.</li>
<li>Set objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable &amp; Ambitious, Realistic, Time-bound</li>
<li>Not be afraid to roll up their sleeves and help out when times are tough.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-do-outside-of-work">What I do outside of work</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am learning how to play the guitar (Started in ~November 2020)</li>
<li>I enjoy organizing parties, making sure to mix my groups of friends. I like introducing people to others they don&rsquo;t know.</li>
<li>Talking about ideas, potential companies, the future.</li>
<li>Reading all kinds of books.</li>
<li>Reading/watching science fiction. I figured it deserved its own bullet.</li>
<li>DIY/Building stuff. I am very hands-on, and I enjoy building physical stuff very much.</li>
<li>Prototyping and maintaining several side projects, for fun and learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-id-love-to-do-in-the-future">Things I&rsquo;d love to do in the future</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build my own company</li>
<li>Build a family</li>
<li>Live in a foreign country</li>
<li>Give back to the Open Source world</li>
<li>Properly Learn Russian and Italian</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-communicate-with-me">How to communicate with me</h3>
<p>Whenever you can, please send a written summary of what is to be discussed. It allows me to build a proper context to switch to when we start the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="preferred-communication-method">Preferred Communication Method</h3>
<p>I rarely consult my phone during the day, it allows me to properly focus. If you send me a message, do not expect an answer within the minute.
If it is REALLY urgent, you can call me right away. I am available on Slack during work time otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="working-hours">Working Hours</h3>
<p>At my desk between 9:30 and 18:00, my lunch break usually starts at 12:00 to avoid rush hour. During the week-end I either work on tools to improve my productivity or on swipeme.io, a serverless side-project to discover the inner-working of the AWS mastodonte.</p>
