## Personal README

Inspired by Adrien Joly's [README](https://github.com/adrienjoly/adrienjoly.github.com), this text aims at introducing myself and sharing some information that may be helpful for us to break the ice, communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow looks like.


### Random facts

- I'm driven by efficiency and improvement in general. This makes me exigent with others, but also with myself.
- I love reading more than anything. I was that guy at school who would wander in the library during recess, looking for a book to finish before the next day.
- It's hard for me to get bored. There is no such thing as "free time" in my world. it's just time to do something else. I like keeping busy, it helps me focus.
- I will always spend more time listening than speaking. I can't/don't want to say anything unless I have all the intel at hand.
- I enjoy much very wit.
- I have no musical education apart from what school taught me, but at 28 I am learning to play the guitar. We will see where it brings me.
- I trust people easily but if you lose that trust, you will have a lot of work to get it back


### What are my favorite things to work on

- Impossible ideas. I take a lot of pleasure in thinking how to turn an idea into doable sub-tasks.
- Learning. Above all, it gives sense to everything I do.
- Tinkering. Building physical stuff.
- Reusing code. The dev environment is a giant lego playground. You can get further by using pieces that already exist rather than building your own.
- Refactoring. Make code more reliable, sustainable and easier to read / troubleshoot / reason about.
- Reading code. I love to see/learn new ways to solve a problem.
- Discussing solutions. I have found marvelous things at the intersection of minds.
- Finding tasks for personal improvements. Applies to me or people I manage, I want to help people be better at what they do.
- Writing automated tests. It frees my mind knowing that a piece of code is covered, and that I would be warned if it stops doing what it is supposed to do.


### What I value from others

- Efficiency & conciseness. No need to wrap your question in fluff and sugar, go straight to the point, I am a fast context switcher. If I am missing something, I will tell you.
- Transparency. I can't go anywhere if I can't see.
- Exigence. I want to be the best at what I do so you better do the same.
- Traceability. So much time is lost trying to remember. Lay it down on paper once and for all and now you can safely forget it.
- Benevolence. Understand what your acts actually mean for others.


### What I think are my strengths

- Accountability. If shit hits the fan under my watch, I will not look the other way. I will make sure to be someone you can rely on.
- Laziness. You can trust me in finding the shortest path.
- Pedagogy. I love to help people understand stuff, and the process of documenting and vulgarizing.
- Leadership. You can't build anything sustainable without people. As it happens I love helping people thrive.


### Things I'm working to improve

- Conflict management. I feel uncomfortable when conflicts happen. I prefer to say nothing until the tension is gone. I am practicing finding the right words during the conflict rather than after.
- Operational constraints. Being more focused on quality, I tend to disregard or lower the importance of operational constraints. I am learning how to compromise.
- Speed. My focus on quality inevitably leads to longer delays. I try to take "quick wins" more into account.


### What makes me uncomfortable

- Finding out things at the very last moment when you know it could have been known beforehand.
- People that react badly to wit. They end up thinking I am making fun of them which makes me very uneasy.
- When people recognize me but I don't. It doesn't happen often, but when it does It makes me feel like I do not give them the respect they deserve.
- Having a conflict in front of people. 99% of conflicts I have to handle are 1 vs. 1. It makes no sense to have this conflict with an audience, apart from discrediting both sides.
- When people talk too much. I won't stop them by politeness, but it makes me feel I am wasting my time and I am afraid my attitude might show disrespect.


### What makes me happy

- Witnessing a small gesture of kindness in the street. (i.e. Somebody giving back a stranger's metro ticket that fell out of her pocket…)
- Helping people.
- When things just work.
- Movement.
- Capoeira.
- Light.
- Fire.
- When a new feature does not need a patch once sent to production.


### What I expect from my managers

- Defend the interests of the team.
- Understand people individually.
- Exigence.
- Managing is to serve, not to be served.
- Criticize in private, congratulate in public.
- Give visibility to the team.
- Exemplarity.
- Set objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable & Ambitious, Realistic, Time-bound
- Not be afraid to roll up their sleeves and help out when times are tough.


### What I do outside of work

- I am learning how to play the guitar (Started in ~November 2020)
- I enjoy organizing parties, making sure to mix my groups of friends. I like introducing people to others they don't know.
- Talking about ideas, potential companies, the future.
- Reading all kinds of books.
- Reading/watching science fiction. I figured it deserved its own bullet.
- DIY/Building stuff. I am very hands-on, and I enjoy building physical stuff very much.
- Prototyping and maintaining several side projects, for fun and learning.


### Things I'd love to do in the future

- Build my own company
- Build a family
- Live in a foreign country
- Give back to the Open Source world
- Properly Learn Russian and Italian


### How to communicate with me

Whenever you can, please send a written summary of what is to be discussed. It allows me to build a proper context to switch to when we start the discussion.


### Preferred Communication Method

I rarely consult my phone during the day, it allows me to properly focus. If you send me a message, do not expect an answer within the minute.
If it is REALLY urgent, you can call me right away. I am available on Slack during work time otherwise.


### Working Hours

At my desk between 9:30 and 18:00, my lunch break usually starts at 12:00 to avoid rush hour. During the week-end I either work on tools to improve my productivity or on swipeme.io, a serverless side-project to discover the inner-working of the AWS mastodonte.
